# What did I do?

I'm working on building the script to send commands to the Arduino to send button presses to the Switch based on Python inputs. I hope to make a self-contained unit at some point that just uses the Arduino or an Ardunino and a Raspberry Pi. 

This project has been a lot of research into how to get the thing doing what I want it to. I haven't really had too much to do coding-wise thanks to the previously mentioned project, but I hope to expand on it ASAP. Quarantine's been tough for me lol
